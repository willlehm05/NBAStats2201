# NBAStats2201
This is our project about the NBA statistics. For this we're gathering a bunch of data throughout the history of the NBA and we're hoping to compare the different generations of NBA players. 
Specifically we have the idea to focus in on the stars of different eras and then compare the stats to each other. What were looking to find is that certain statistics became more important in certain eras. Or look at things like if Michael Jordan was a player in 2025, would he still be a star.
At some point we'll likely have to cut off how far back we go. We both think that it may be hard to get good and complete datasets from like the 1950s
