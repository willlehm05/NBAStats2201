# NBAStats2201
This is our project about the NBA statistics. For this we're gathering a bunch of data throughout the history of the NBA and
we're hoping to compare the different generations of NBA players. 

Specifically we have the idea to focus in on the stars of different eras and then compare the stats to each other. What were looking to find is that certain statistics became more important in certain eras. Or look at things like if Michael Jordan was a player in 2025, would he still be a star.

Our data is largely based around this one data set we found online that has statistics for every player going back to 1949. However, there are a lot of missing pieces or data points in the older data. After looking at it we decided that 1980 should be as far back as we go. The dataset also only went up to 2022 so we updated the dataset with data from 2023 and 2024.

There is a little bit of missing data in some parts of the data set. The only one that had a large chunk of missing pieces was the games started statistic. But we didn't think it mattered very much since the data for games played is all filled in. There's also blanks for players who didn't attept any 3 point shots in their 3 point percentage, but those all can just be converted to zeroes.
